# Parallax Website

Welcome to the Parallax Website project! This repository contains the code for a parallax website that utilizes the parallax effect to create an immersive browsing experience.

## Description

This website incorporates the parallax effect to give the illusion of depth and dimensionality as users scroll down the page. The background features a captivating mountain photo, while a person photo is positioned in front of the mountain. As users scroll, the background and foreground elements move at different speeds, creating a visually engaging effect.

## Implementation Details

The parallax effect is achieved using CSS 3D transforms. By applying CSS properties such as `transform`, `perspective`, and `translateZ`, we create the illusion of depth and motion as users interact with the website.
