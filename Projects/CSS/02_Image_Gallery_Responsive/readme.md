## Description

This project showcases a responsive image gallery created solely using HTML and CSS. The gallery consists of 15 images organized in a grid layout, with each row containing three images. Upon initial rendering, the images appear with a grayscale filter, giving them a muted appearance.

The distinctive feature of this gallery is the interactive hover effect implemented using CSS. When the mouse hovers over an image, it dynamically transforms to reveal its true colors, providing a captivating visual experience for the viewer. Additionally, hovering over an image displays its name, adding a layer of information and context to each picture.

The hover effect is achieved through CSS transitions and transforms, allowing for smooth and seamless transitions between the grayscale and colored states. This not only enhances the aesthetics of the gallery but also adds an element of interactivity, engaging users as they explore the images.

The gallery is designed to be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes and devices. Whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the images maintain their visual appeal and functionality, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience for all users.

This project demonstrates the power and versatility of HTML and CSS in creating visually stunning and interactive web content without the need for JavaScript or complex frameworks. It serves as an example of how simple yet effective techniques can be used to elevate the user experience and make web pages more engaging and dynamic.
