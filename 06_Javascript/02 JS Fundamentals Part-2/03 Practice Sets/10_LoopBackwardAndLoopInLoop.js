/*
LECTURE: Looping Backwards and Loops in Loops
1. Store this array of arrays into a variable called 'listOfNeighbours'
[['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden', 
'Russia']];
2. Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire 
arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country
3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't 
worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway
