// 1. create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.
// 2. use typeof operator to find out the data type of the string in question 1.
// 3. create a const object in js. can you change it to hold a number later?
// 4. try to add a new key to the const object of previous questions.
//     were you able to do it?
// 5. write a JS program to create a word-meaning dictionary of 5 words.

// solutions are below.............
// chapter 1 -Q1
let str = "rahat";
let num = 8;
str = str + num;
console.log(str);

// Q2
console.log(typeof str);
// string + number = string

// Q3
const ob = {
  age: 25,
  income: 33000,
};
// ob = "rahat"; ob can not be reassigned
console.log(ob);

// Q4
// changing age property of const object ob
ob.age = 22; // this is possible
console.log(ob);

// adding new key/ propery to const object ob
ob.status = "unmarried"; // this is also possible
console.log(ob);
// so we can add new property and change value of them in a const object
// but const object can not be reassigned to any other object like number,boolean etc.

/*
üí° What does 'const' mean when used with objects in JavaScript?

- Using 'const' with an object means the **reference** (or binding) to that object cannot be changed.
- However, the **contents inside the object (properties)** CAN be modified.

‚úÖ Allowed:
- Modifying existing properties
- Adding new properties

Example:
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
person.age = 30;              // ‚úÖ Allowed
person.country = "Bangladesh"; // ‚úÖ Allowed

‚ùå Not Allowed:
- Reassigning the entire object to a new value

person = { name: "Bob" };     // ‚ùå Error: Assignment to constant variable

üîê To make an object truly immutable (read-only), use Object.freeze():

const person = Object.freeze({ name: "Alice", age: 25 });
person.age = 30;              // ‚ùå Won‚Äôt change
person.city = "Dhaka";        // ‚ùå Won‚Äôt be added

üß† Summary:
- 'const' protects the reference, not the object‚Äôs contents.
- Use Object.freeze() if you want to prevent modifications to the object.
