    <!-- Explanation of color models -->
    <h5>Understanding Color Models</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Color by Name:</strong> You can use predefined color names such
        as "red", "blue", etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hexadecimal (Hex):</strong> A six-character string starting with
        "#" (e.g., #ff6347), where the first two characters represent red, the
        next two represent green, and the last two represent blue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RGB:</strong> Uses a combination of Red, Green, and Blue, with
        values ranging from 0 to 255 (e.g., rgb(255, 0, 0) for red).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RGBA:</strong> Like RGB but includes an alpha channel for
        transparency (e.g., rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) is a semi-transparent red).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HSL:</strong> Defines colors by Hue (0°-360°), Saturation
        (0%-100%), and Lightness (0%-100%) (e.g., hsl(120, 100%, 50%) for
        green).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HSLA:</strong> Like HSL but includes an alpha channel for
        transparency (e.g., hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.5) is a semi-transparent
        green).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hex with Alpha:</strong> A hexadecimal code with an 8-character
        format that includes alpha transparency (e.g., #ff634780). The last two
        characters represent alpha (e.g., 80 = 50% opacity).
      </li>
    </ul>
