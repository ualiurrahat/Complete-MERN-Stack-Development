## 📄 Project Overview

**Tindog Project** (also titled **PetDog**) is a responsive landing page created as part of my responsive web design practice.  
It’s a fun parody of Tinder — but for dogs! The project demonstrates how to use **Bootstrap 5**, **Font Awesome**, and **custom CSS** to build a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly website layout.

This project focuses on mastering layout design, responsiveness, and UI composition using Bootstrap’s grid system and utility classes.
